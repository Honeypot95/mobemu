This file contains information on Experiment 2

Location: Computer Lab, University of Cambridge

Date: End of January 2005

Duration: 
	  Devices distributed on Tuesday, January 25th, 2005 at 14:00am
	  Devices collected on Monday, January 31st, 2005 in the afternoon
	  (most of the iMotes last around 5days)

Participants: 
19 graduate students from the System Research Group.

Collected datas: 
- Some of the iMotes did not deliver any useful data, as a consequence
of accidental hardware reset. Contacts with one of them were discarded
from the traces of other iMotes to avoid any consequence on the
experimental results.

- In total only 12 iMotes could be used to produce this trace, others were
suffering from hardward resets. The contacts with these nodes were
discarded from the complete   

- Details of ID number:
	ID 1-12 are corresponding to iMotes (Class 1)
	ID 13-223 corresponds to external devices (Class 2)
